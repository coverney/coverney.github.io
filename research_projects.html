                  Voice to Vision: Enhancing Civic Decision-Making through
                  Co-Designed Data Infrastructure
                </h3>
                <p>
                  As trust in community engagement and democratic
                  decision-making declines, there's an urgent need for increased
                  transparency and accountability in civic processes. For this
                  project, I collaborated with the New York City Department of
                  City Planning to co-design data infrastructure that enhances
                  civic decision-making. Using a research-through-design
                  approach with both planners and community members, we
                  developed an interoperable data structure and an interactive
                  visualization system with two key components: a
                  community-facing platform that clearly demonstrates how public
                  input informed decisions, and a planner-facing tool that
                  supports the complex sensemaking process of analyzing
                  community feedback. Voice to Vision addresses critical gaps in
                  current engagement processes by providing communities with
                  clear responses to their input while offering planners
                  essential support for analyzing diverse feedback. This project
                  contributes to the participatory design space while offering
                  practical tools that can help rebuild trust in civic
                  decision-making processes.

                  Evaluating Narrative Strategies for Constructive Community
                  Engagement
                </h3>
                <p>
                  In contentious community issues like school redistricting,
                  effective communication is essential but challenging. For this
                  project, I'm collaborating with Winston-Salem/Forsyth County
                  Schools to investigate how narrative strategies can foster
                  understanding across diverse perspectives during their
                  redistricting process. I developed and evaluated 124
                  AI-generated, human-reviewed narrative summaries that distill
                  community input from over 13,000 comments, 8,300 survey
                  responses, and 170+ hours of audio recordings. Through a field
                  deployment, user studies with community members, and
                  controlled experiments, I'm examining how varying the balance
                  between concrete experiences and abstract opinions in
                  narratives influences readers' understanding and engagement.
                  This research explores how AI can help create narratives that
                  reflect both diverse and shared experiences within large
                  communities, and how narrative strategies can effectively
                  demonstrate that community input was meaningfully considered
                  in decision-making processes.

                  Coalesce: An Accessible Mixed-Initiative System for Designing
                  Community-Centric Questionnaires
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Effective community engagement is crucial for inclusive
                  governance, but civic leaders often struggle to design
                  questions that gather meaningful input due to time constraints
                  and limited experience. For this project, I developed
                  Coalesce, a mixed-initiative system that leverages AI to help
                  civic leaders craft tailored and impactful questions for
                  surveys, interviews, and conversation guides. Drawing on
                  questionnaire design best practices, Coalesce improves
                  question readability, enhances specificity, and reduces bias.
                  The system was developed through interviews with 30 civic
                  leaders and 14 iterative feedback sessions. In real-world
                  evaluations with 16 participants using Coalesce for their own
                  community projects, we found it improved their confidence in
                  questionnaire design, supported diverse workflows, and
                  fostered learning while raising important considerations about
                  human agency and AI reliance. This work demonstrates how
                  intelligent user interfaces can help civic leaders engage more
                  effectively with their communities.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  School district attendance boundaries significantly impact
                  educational access and equity, but community engagement
                  processes for changing these boundaries are often polarizing
                  and ineffective. I collaborated with a large US school
                  district serving nearly 150,000 students to design
                  BoundarEase, a web platform that helps community members
                  explore and provide feedback on potential boundary changes.
                  Through formative interviews with 16 community members, we
                  identified key challenges in existing engagement processes:
                  individualistic thinking, lack of empathy for different
                  perspectives, and difficulty understanding policy impacts. The
                  BoundarEase platform addresses these frictions by visualizing
                  proposals and facilitating structured feedback based on
                  community preferences. Our user study with 12 participants
                  showed that BoundarEase encouraged people to consider impacts
                  beyond their own families and increased transparency around
                  policy proposals. This project offers both a practical tool
                  for school districts and insights into how technology can
                  reduce polarization in local educational policymaking.

                  for Strategic Storytelling
                </h3>
                <p>
                  While storytelling is essential for self-advocacy, people
                  often struggle to develop and deliver strategic narratives,
                  especially in high-stakes situations. For this project, I'm
                  developing Sage, a hybrid architecture chatbot that supports
                  strategic storytelling by combining traditional rule-based
                  systems with the generative capabilities of large language
                  models. Through evaluation with 21 experts across negotiation,
                  communications, and HCI fields, we've demonstrated the
                  effectiveness of this hybrid approach while exploring the
                  fundamental tension between authenticity and impact in
                  AI-assisted storytelling. Our findings reveal important design
                  considerations for conversational AI systems, particularly
                  around memory management and preserving narrative authority.
                  This work offers insights into how AI can empower marginalized
                  voices while maintaining the structural effectiveness required
                  for high-stakes communication.

                  SenseMate: An Accessible and Beginner-Friendly Human-AI
                  Platform for Qualitative Data Analysis
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Many community organizations want to engage in conversations
                  with their constituents but lack the support they need to
                  analyze feedback through qualitative data analysis (QDA), or
                  sensemaking. As a result, it's important to provide accessible
                  entry points into the analysis process for people with no
                  prior experience. For my master's thesis, I designed
                  SenseMate, an AI-based platform to support non-researchers in
                  qualitative coding. After developing a codebook, or a list of
                  themes, from a subset of the data, qualitative coding involves
                  applying the codebook to all the data. SenseMate aims to
                  transparently recommend themes for pieces of text to increase
                  the efficiency and reliability of qualitative coding. Through
                  an online experiment with 180 novice users, we found that
                  SenseMate increased intercoder reliability by 29% and improved
                  coding accuracy by 10%. The platform features rationale
                  extraction models that provide explainable AI recommendations
                  while preserving user privacy and control, making it uniquely
                  suited for community organizations with limited resources.

                <h3>Shared Mobility Visual Analytics Tool</h3>
                <p>
                  I created a visual analytics tool that can help city planners
                  manage their shared mobility services. The tool is a React web
                  application that analyzes scooter-share event data, estimates
                  spatial demand, and generates an interactive data
                  visualization page where users can map out usage and demand.

                  How to Not Get Rich: An Empirical Study of Donations in Open
                  Source
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Open source is ubiquitous and forms the digital infrastructure
                  of our society, yet sustaining open source has become
                  increasingly difficult due to growing demands and developer
                  burnout. Donations are gaining in popularity as a potential
                  method of sustaining open source. This research project is the
                  first large-scale study to investigate the prevalence and
                  impact of donations on open source.

                <p>
                  In this data science project, I explored the causal

                  estimators. I applied the economic concept of complements and
                  substitutes to analyze how bikesharing could be used to
                  support or supplant the first-mile/last-mile problem.

                  analysis workflows in TASBE.

                  my programming and data science knowledge to analyze
                  metagenomics data to understand nutrient cycling, apply
                  network analysis to examine the effects of perturbation on
                  microbial communities, and write software that mines genome
                  databases.
